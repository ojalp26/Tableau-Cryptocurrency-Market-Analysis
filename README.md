## 🚀 Project Overview

This project presents a **historical analysis of the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization from 2013 to 2019**.  
It uses a clean and structured dataset to uncover key trends in prices, volatility, trading volume, and correlations — all presented through an **interactive Tableau dashboard**.

## 💡 Motivation

The crypto market has seen explosive growth but is still poorly understood.  
While raw data exists, this project transforms it into clear visual insights to explore questions like:

- 📈 What is the correlation between Bitcoin and altcoin prices?  
- 📅 Which days of the week had better average returns historically?  
- ⚡ Which currencies had the most volatility?  
- 💰 How did market capitalization and volume grow over time?

> This project aims to lay the foundation for more advanced quantitative and predictive analysis.
